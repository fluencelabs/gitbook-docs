## Fluence Proto Distributor: FLDIST

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that we are in the process of deprecating `fldist` in favor of [Aqua CLI](https://github.com/fluencelabs/aqua/tree/main/cli). At the time of this writing, `fldist` remains fully functional **except** for the `run_air` command, which needs to be replace with `aqua run`.&#x20;

We are currently in the process of updating the documentation to reflect these changes. If you run into an errant `fldist` reference, please let us now!
{% endhint %}

[`fldist`](https://github.com/fluencelabs/proto-distributor) is a command line interface (CLI) to Fluence peers allowing for the lifecycle management of services and offers the fastest and most effective way to service deployment.
