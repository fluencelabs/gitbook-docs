# Changelog

Fluence JS versioning scheme is the following: `0.BREAKING.ENHANCING`

* `0` shows that Fluence JS does not meet its vision yet, so API can change quickly
* `BREAKING` part is incremented for each breaking API change
* `ENHANCING` part is incremented for every fix and update which is compatible on API level
