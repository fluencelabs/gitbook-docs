# Thinking In Aquamarine

Building and operating distributed networks, backends and applications are non-trivial undertakings not only posing technical challenges but also requiring a significant shift in how to view and think in distributed.

Consider a workflow tasked with calling multiple REST endpoints, in sequence, where the response of the previous call is the input to the current call. As illustrated in Figure 1, the application is the focal point and data relay.



Peer-to-peer networks offer a advantages including architectural advantages over centralized solutions such as client-server architectures. 



A prominent improvement made possible with peer-to-peer networks is a fundamental shift in Request-Response processing.

 Consider a workflow tasked with calling multiple REST endpoints, in sequence, where the response of the previous call is the input to the current call. As illustrated in Figure 1, the application is the focal point and data relay and a typical client-server solution tends to require the client to process approximately n-to-n request-response calls.

Peer-to-peer networks allow for a different data management pattern. Instead of a client-centric Request-Response processing pattern, peer-to-peer networks allow the forward-chaining of responses directly into the intended consumers: no "client relay" necessary. Hence, a peer-to-peer client can be notably reduced to a n-to-one pattern. See Figure 2.

Of course, such capabilities don't just come with the availability of peer-to-peer networking but are the result of additional runtimes and programming tools to enable such behavior on each node. Fluence Labs's Aquamarine provides the required open source runtime and programming tools to allow developers to take full advantage of inherent peer-to-peer capabilities. 

Programming peer-to-peer applications with Aquamarine entails scripting a workflow in the Aqua language to coordinate deployed distributed network services into the desired application and execution logic. As a probably somewhat novel design to most developers, the workflow is part of a data structure that also includes the data, in form of a conflict-free replication data type \(CRDT\), which follows the programmatically specific execution route\(s\) for services and nodes. In Fluence parlance, we call the data structure a _particle_. 

Particles are executed in the AIR interpreter on top of the Marine VM and in conjunction with Aqua allows for the separation of services' business logic from the workflows coordinating services, which in turn allows a much more favorable request-response processing model. Moreover, Aquamarine pushes execution management into Aqua scripts allowing developers to incorporate and control resource management, such as sequential or parallel execution, at the particle traversal level. And finally, particles are subject to strict cryptographic ??? allowing for cryptographic verification at every hop. 



This is a rather cursory overview of probably the most salient conceptual difference developers need to take into consideration in order to succeed programming distributed networks and applications. Luckily, Aquamarine and the Fluence stack eliminate most, if not all, of the heavy lifting necessary to develop high-value per-to-peer networks, backends, and applications.
