# Introduction

Fluence Labs provides an open protocol and open source framework to create modern peer-to-peer Web 3.0 internet applications from distributed Wasm building blocks without having to rely on centralized and untrustworthy parties.

Aquamarine, Fluence Labs' open-source development and runtime environment, allows application developers to take full advantage of peer-to-peer architectures and to compose applications by using and reusing Wasm services deployed to one or more peers. Aquamarine enables the ergonomic development of decentralized applications and consists of:

* [Aqua](https://github.com/fluencelabs/aqua), a non-Touring complete interface description language \(IDL\) to compose distributed Wasm services deployed to one or more nodes into applications
* [AIR](https://github.com/fluencelabs/air), an interpreter/VM for moving data and scripts across network destinations as programmatically specified by the Aqua application script
* [Marine](https://github.com/fluencelabs/marine), an Aqua VM and Wasm runtime environment for deployment on peer-to-peer nodes, such as Fluence Labs' peer-to-peer node reference implementation

~~The remainder of this document introduces a set of incremental, hands-on tutorials developing with Aquamarine on the Fluence stack.~~
