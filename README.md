# Introduction

Fluence Labs builds distributed networks, development tools, components and support systems to allow developers to efficiently and reliably build, operate, maintain, and monetize distributed and decentralized services and applications. An integral component of the Fluence solution is Aquamarine, a programming and runtime stack purpose-built to program peer-to-peer networks, backends and applications.

Aquamarine is comprised of:

* Aqua -- add, link
* Aqua VM -- add, link
* Marine VM -- add, link

Aquamarine provides the programming and runtime tools that allow developers to avoid the typical peer-to-peer development challenges and accelerate the development and deployment of distributed services and applications.

The remainder of this document introduces a set of incremental, hands-on tutorials developing with Aquamarine on the Fluence stack.
