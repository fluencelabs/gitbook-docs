# Introduction

Fluence Labs provides an open protocol and open source framework to create modern Web 3.0 internet applications from distributed Wasm building blocks without having to rely on centralized and untrustworthy parties.

Aquamarine, Fluence Labs' open-source development and runtime environment, enables the ergonomic development of decentralized applications and consists of:

* [Aqua](https://github.com/fluencelabs/aqua), a non-Touring complete interface description language \(IDL\) to compose distributed Wasm services deployed to one or more nodes into applications
* [AIR](https://github.com/fluencelabs/air), an interpreter/VM for moving data and scripts across network destinations as programmatically specified by the Aqua application script
* [Marine](https://github.com/fluencelabs/marine), an Aqua VM and Wasm runtime environment for deployment on peer-to-peer nodes, such as Fluence Labs' peer-to-peer node reference implementation

Aquamarine allows application developers to take full advantage of peer-to-peer architectures and to compose applications by using and \(re-\)using Wasm services deployed to one or more peers of a peer-to-peer network.

The remainder of this document introduces a set of incremental, hands-on tutorials developing with Aquamarine on the Fluence stack.
