# Aqua

&#x20;At the core of Fluence is the open-source language **Aqua** that allows for the programming of peer-to-peer scenarios separately from the computations on peers.&#x20;

Please see the[ Aqua book ](https://doc.fluence.dev/aqua-book/)for an introduction to the language and reference materials.
